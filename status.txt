Some questions to consider:

Does your code build properly with "stack build"?
Yes, it fully compiles with no warnings or errors

Are there any parts of the specification you did not implement in 
part A?
No, although handling of a bad url waits for the connection timeout, 
which makes the test last about 1.5 minutes

For the 'stretch' part B, which libraries did you use and what kind of
output did you generate?
I attempted to use the Google Translate API, but ran into several 
issues that I didn't have time to solve
